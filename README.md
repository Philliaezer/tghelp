### Answers

1. This project is intended to offer to people who use Telegram the abiity to understand how this platform can be perfectelly conditioned to their lives and their productivity.
2.  I started this project because I think - and that's a fact - that Telegram, after all, does <u>not</u> offers an excelent way to guide and "tutoriate" the new commers. And, as I believe that this community deserves it and a lot more, I gave myself this initiative.
3. I saw that this project was taking a lot of my efforts in such way, that was - and remains - fair enough to create a dedicated repo for it.
